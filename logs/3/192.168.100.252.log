YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS 					AGREEMENT AND<br />					2.

Access <br />					points or Enabled Locations may not be available in all 					areas of the Facilities, and may not always be operational.					<br />					No Fee for WiFi System <br />					Use of the WiFi System is free.
